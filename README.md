# iOS Astrology Animation

Our design team at Handsome created an [amazing Astrology animation](https://dribbble.com/shots/2299696-Astrology-Mobile-App-Animation). 
The engeneering team took up a challenge to implement this animation for iOS.

#### If you like the result, please, give your :star: to this repository.

It was decided to use [iOS10 Animation SDK](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiviewanimating) in order to control timing functions, so that the animation looks more identical to the designed one. For simple motions we used typical [UIView animations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/1622515-animatewithduration). Also, we added a bubbly motion effect to the circle on the bottom icons using [Core Animation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/cabasicanimation).

The Astrology motion is combined with a few independent animations like Moon and Sun movement, animating circles around the space objects, partickles effect, graph stretching, and a few more motions. Please, check out the implementation to get more details.

### A few things from Animations SDK that you'll find in the code

- Working with `UIViewPropertyAnimator` objects;
- Creating custom-easing functions, based on Cubic BÃ©zier curves.
